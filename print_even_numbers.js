// 1. Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10
//    Try to make the solution to this problem as efficient as possible.
//    Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest    characters/commands.
//    Get creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.
